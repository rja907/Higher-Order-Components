# Higher Order Components in React

This repo is for myself. I doubt anyone would find any use of this. But any way...

A Higher order Component is a Component that adds some additional functionality to the already existing Component.

This app is used for access controls by showing a user who is signed in the resources page or rerouting a user who is not signed in to the home page.

We will now build a Higher Order functions so that we can set up the authentication in one place and then use it everywhere.
